Cloudknot
========
Cloudknot is a python library designed to run your existing python code on
AWS Batch

Cloudknot takes as input a python function, Dockerizes it for use in an Amazon
ECS instance, and creates all the necessary AWS Batch constituent resources to
submit jobs. You can then use cloudknot to submit and view jobs for a range of
inputs.

To get started using cloudknot, please see the documentation_.
